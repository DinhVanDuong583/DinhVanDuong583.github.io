	<h3>This familiar theme will occur in all seven section of the toiec test it is genenrally about office situation such as meeting conferences. office equitment, policies and procedures and is related directly to both the personnel and purchasing themes( see thng in the office in the purchasing section)
	In the office ,situations will be about all kind of meeting ,memos,letter emails, derparments,all kinds of equipment that has to be look after such as photocopiers,fax machines,computers,air conditioners,telephones.It is help full to understand colocations such as "to sack some one'"'to fire someone'"or show someone the doorr'"or 'let someone go' all of which mean terminate (end) someone's employment.To repeat an earlier point, single words, and their synonyms are not enough to do well on the toiec test,This is parricularly the case in conversations of an informal nature where the chance of hearing 'common'or idiomatic language increases.The office theme also ues verbal annoucements and written memos to communicate important news to the employees,These would tend to be more formal and thus less difficult to comprehend than face-to-face conversations.

	Good afternoon everybody.We are here this afternoon to discuss the lack of space in our office.As you all know, the beginning of this month,we added five new members to the marketing team,Which increases the number of staff members working on the third floor of the building to 20 people.This has made it really difficult for us to hold weekly group meeting as there are too many chairs and desks.Therefore,in order to create more space for everybody, we will need to get rid of all the files and books that we no longer need.Those things are taking up all of our space in the office.The old table at the back of the office should also be moved to the sencond floor so that we can move more freely around here.

	Attention everybody.I have an important annoucement to make.In a meeting with the other managers yesterday,we came to the conclusion that we must do everything to increase our sales this year. It is a known fact that a strong sales team is the force behind any successfull company, especially companies like us. What good is a great product if the salespeople do not roll up their sleeves and sell it?Therefore ,we have decided to do something to help ypu get the sales you want. From now to the end of the year,you will be going to improve your sales experts in the industry to get the skills you need, and I belive that will make all the difference.We are hoping that by December of this year,we will be able to reach the goal we set for ourselves at the beginning of this year.
